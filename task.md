# Task: Refactor and Integrate a Skin Cancer Detection Desktop Application

**Objective:**
You are tasked with architecting and implementing the core components of a desktop application designed for medical professionals to detect potential skin cancer (melanoma) by analyzing images of moles. The application should provide a percentage likelihood of melanoma. The refactoring involves integrating separately developed frontend (QML) and backend (Python) components, establishing a clean project structure, and ensuring proper data flow and model interaction.

**Given (Conceptual Inputs):**

1.  **Frontend Description:** A QML-based user interface for a desktop application. This UI is *not* based on Qt Widgets.
2.  **Backend Logic Description:** Python-based backend logic responsible for business operations, database interactions, and machine learning model inference.
3.  **Database Schema:** A definition of the MySQL database structure (conceptually, the `database_structure.sql` content).
4.  **Machine Learning Model:** An existing machine learning model (e.g., in `.h5` format) capable of predicting melanoma probability from a processed image.
5.  **Core Technologies:** Python, Qt QML (via PySide), MySQL.
6.  **Development Environment:** The project should be compatible with Qt Creator.

**Key Responsibilities:**

1.  **Project Architecture and Structuring:**
    *   Design and implement a clean, modular, and maintainable project directory structure suitable for a Python/QML application.
    *   Ensure a dedicated location for machine learning model files (e.g., a `models/` directory).
    *   Organize source code into logical components (e.g., UI, backend services, data access, ML integration).

2.  **Codebase Refinement:**
    *   Identify and remove any code or components related to Qt Widgets, ensuring the application exclusively uses QML for its graphical interface.
    *   Eliminate any redundant, unused, or deprecated files and code segments from the conceptual initial state.

3.  **Backend-Frontend Integration:**
    *   Establish a robust communication bridge between the Python backend and the QML frontend using PySide.
    *   Design and implement Python classes/modules that expose necessary data and functionality (e.g., image processing triggers, result display, patient data management) to the QML layer. This should allow QML to invoke Python methods and react to Python signals or property changes.

4.  **Data Management and Flow:**
    *   Develop Python components to interact with the MySQL database based on the provided schema. This includes functionalities for storing and retrieving patient information, image metadata, and prediction results.
    *   Create data handling mechanisms (e.g., data transfer objects, view models) to facilitate the exchange of information between the database, backend logic, and the QML frontend.

5.  **Machine Learning Model Integration:**
    *   Implement Python logic to load the specified machine learning model (e.g., `.h5` file).
    *   Develop image preprocessing routines as required by the ML model.
    *   Create a service or function that takes an image (or its path), preprocesses it, feeds it to the ML model, and retrieves the melanoma prediction percentage.

6.  **Qt Creator Compatibility:**
    *   Ensure the project's configuration (e.g., `pyproject.toml` or similar dependency/project management files) is structured to be easily opened, managed, and run within the Qt Creator IDE for Python projects.

**Expected Output:**

*   A well-structured Python/QML project.
*   A functional application where the QML frontend can trigger backend operations (e.g., select an image, process it).
*   The backend can perform image analysis using the ML model, store/retrieve data from MySQL, and communicate results back to the QML frontend for display (specifically, the melanoma percentage).
*   The codebase should be clean, with widget-based UI elements removed.

**Constraints & Considerations for the AI:**

*   The primary GUI technology is QML for desktop.
*   The backend logic is Python.
*   Database is MySQL.
*   ML models are pre-trained (e.g., `.h5` files).
*   Consider asynchronous operations for long-running tasks (like image processing or model inference) to keep the UI responsive.
*   Prioritize clarity, modularity, and maintainability in the generated code and structure.
